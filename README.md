## Summary

A simple podcast downloader.

## Overview

I wasn't a huge fan of the various podcast downloaders which I've used over
the years, and they tended to slowly lose support over time. After having 
migrated for the Nth time I finally gave up and just wrote my own.

It may work for you too, or it may not. I've been using is for a few years
now and it seems to do it's job.

## Bugs/TODOs

Sometimes it can download something more than once, if the source changes 
certain meta-data. One of these days I'll figure out what that is, and fix
it. However, it doesn't happen that much and `rm` is a quick and easy solution
when it does.
